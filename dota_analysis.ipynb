    "\n",
    "Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is played in matches between two teams of five players, the _Radiant_ and the _Dire_, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a \"hero\", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's \"Ancient\", a large structure located within their base.<sup>[1]</sup>\n",
